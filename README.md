Introduction

HBNB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, front-end, HTML/CSS templating, API,and others.

This is a team project part of the ALX School Software Engineering program
It represents the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone.

This AirBnB clone consists of:

a custom command-line interface for data management,
and the base classes for the storage of this data.

Usage

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.
It prints a prompt (hbnb) and waits for the user's input

The console will :

Create an object
Show an object
Show all objects, or all instances of a class
Destroy an object
